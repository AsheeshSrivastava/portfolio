# Detailed Notes
Python, being a dynamically-typed language, offers a variety of data types. The main data types in Python are:

1. [[游닌Numeric Data Types| Numeric Types]]
    
    - **int:**Integer, a whole number without a fractional part (e.g., 5, -3, 42).
    - **float:**Floating-point number, a number with a decimal point (e.g., 3.14, -0.001, 2.0).
    - **complex:**Complex number, a number with a real and imaginary part (e.g., 3 + 4j).
2. [[游닌Boolean Data Types in Python| Boolean Type]]
    
    - **bool:**Represents two values:`True`맖r`False`. Often the result of comparison operations.
3. **Text Type:**
    
    - **str:**String, used for text. Defined by either single ('...') or double ("...") quotes (e.g., "Hello", 'Python').
4. **Sequence Types:**
    
    - **list:**ㅁn ordered, mutable collection of items. Items can be of different types (e.g., [1, 'a', 3.14]).
    - **tuple:**ㅁn ordered, immutable collection of items. Tuples are defined using parentheses (e.g., (1, 'a', 3.14)).
    - **range:**ㅁ sequence of numbers generated based on start, stop, and step parameters (e.g., range(0, 10)).
5. **Mapping Type:**
    
    - **dict:**Dictionary, a collection of key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable (e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}).
6. **Set Types:**
    
    - **set:**ㅁn unordered collection of unique items (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).
    - **frozenset:**Like a set, but immutable.
7. **Binary Types:**
    
    - **bytes:**ㅁn immutable sequence of bytes (e.g., b'Hello').
    - **bytearray:**ㅁ mutable sequence of bytes.
    - **memoryview:**ㅁ memory view object of the underlying bytes of an object.
8. **None Type:**
    
    - **None:**Represents the absence of a value or a null value.

These types are the building blocks for data manipulation in Python, allowing for a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex systems.
