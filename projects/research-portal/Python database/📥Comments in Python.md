# Key Points:

- Comments are primarily used for explaining and making the code more readable.
- In Python, the hash symbol `#` is used for single-line comments.
- This is the common practice for multi-line comments in Python, even though they're technically not treated as comments by the interpreter.
- Comments are indeed used for documentation purposes and do not affect the execution of the code.
- Comments are best used for explaining tricky parts of the code where the reasoning might not be immediately obvious.
- The primary reason for using comments – to make the code more understandable.
- The triple-quoted section is treated as a multi-line string and ignored.
- In Python, you need to put a `#` in front of every line you want to comment out.
- Comments are ignored during execution and are only for the benefit of the programmer.

# Detailed Notes:


Comments can be used to explain the code for more readability. Comments are a crucial part of programming in Python (as in most programming languages), serving several important purposes:

1. **Explanation**: They can explain what a particular part of the code does, making it easier for someone (including your future self) to understand the code when they look at it later.
    
2. **Debugging**: Sometimes, you might want to temporarily disable a piece of code without deleting it. You can turn these lines into comments, which Python will ignore during execution.
    
3. **Readability**: Comments can be used to break up the code into sections, making it more readable and organized.
    

In Python, there are two types of comments:

### Single-line Comments:

- Begin with a hash symbol (`#`).
- Everything following the `#` on that line will be ignored by Python.

Example: 

```python
# This is a single-line comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a greeting

```

### Multi-line Comments:

Python doesn't have a distinct syntax for multi-line comments. However, you can use a multi-line string (enclosed in triple quotes) as a comment. While not technically a comment, Python will ignore these strings if they're not assigned to a variable.

Example:

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment
It spans multiple lines
"""
print("Hello, World!")

```

# Relevance:

Using comments for my code/s or code snippet will help me remeber what the logic for the code is and/or why I have created the particular snippet. This practise of writing coding will not only help me in learn python programming but also in general coding or learning a new language like JavaScript.
