### Day 1 (6 Hours)

**Morning Session (3 Hours)**

1. **Python Introduction (1 Hour)**: Refresh basics, history, and applications.
2. **Components of a Python Program (1 Hour)**: Review syntax, keywords, identifiers.
3. **Data Types in Python (1 Hour)**: Revisit different data types, their uses, and examples.

**Afternoon Session (3 Hours)**

1. **Operators in Python (1 Hour)**: Focus on arithmetic, logical, and other operators.
2. **Strings in Python (1 Hour)**: Understand string manipulation and methods.
3. **Control Statements (1 Hour)**: Go over if, else, loops, and flow control mechanisms.

### Day 2 (6 Hours)

**Morning Session (3 Hours)**

1. **Lists in Python (1 Hour)**: Review list operations, slicing, and methods.
2. **Tuples in Python (1 Hour)**: Refresh your understanding of tuples and their immutability.
3. **Dictionaries in Python (1 Hour)**: Revisit key-value pairs, accessing, and manipulating dictionaries.

**Afternoon Session (3 Hours)**

1. **Sets in Python (1.5 Hours)**: Understand sets, their operations like union, intersection, etc.
2. **Review and Practice (1.5 Hours)**: Revise all topics, practice MCQs, and simulate test conditions.

### Strategy:

- **Active Learning**: While studying, write down key points and try out code examples.
- **Practice MCQs**: After each session, answer MCQs related to the topic to solidify your understanding.
- **Breaks**: Take short breaks (5-10 mins) every hour to avoid fatigue.
- **Conceptual Understanding**: Emphasize understanding the 'why' and 'how' of concepts, not just memorizing.
- **Evening Review**: At the end of each day, spend 30 minutes reviewing what you've learned.

### Additional Tips:

- **Utilize Resources**: Refer to the PDFs for in-depth understanding and examples.
- **Seek Clarification**: If you're unclear about any concept, feel free to ask for clarification or examples.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Write and run small Python scripts to test your understanding of concepts.

### Topics Involved:

1. **Syntax and Basics**
    
    - Comments (`#`)
    - Basic operations (e.g., `2 ** 3`)
    - Data types (strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries)
    - Variable naming rules
2. **Control Structures**
    
    - Loops (usage of `break`)
    - Conditional statements
3. **Functions and Methods**
    
    - Built-in functions (e.g., `len()`, `type()`, `print()`)
    - String methods (e.g., `lower()`)
    - List methods (e.g., `append()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, `remove()`)
4. **Advanced Concepts**
    
    - Special method names (`__init__()`, `__str__()`)
    - Working with modules (`re` for regular expressions)
    - Argument unpacking (`*args` and `**kwargs`)
    - Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, instances, inheritance)
5. **Miscellaneous Concepts**
    
    - Tuples and their peculiarities
    - Enumerate and zip functions
    - The `pass` statement
    - The `with` statement for context management

### 3-Day Study Plan:

**Day 1: Basics and Syntax**

- Focus on Python syntax and basic programming constructs.
- Review variable naming, data types, basic operations, and built-in functions.
- Practice with simple code snippets and MCQs related to these topics.
- Resources: Python documentation, online Python tutorials, and interactive Python coding platforms.

**Day 2: Control Structures and Functions**

- Dive into loops, conditional statements, and function definitions.
- Understand the usage of list and string methods.
- Pay special attention to Python-specific features like `break` in loops.
- Practice with MCQs that focus on these areas.

**Day 3: Advanced Concepts and Miscellaneous Topics**

- Study object-oriented programming concepts, focusing on the use of `__init__()` and `__str__()` methods.
- Review how to use modules like `re`.
- Understand the nuances of `*args`, `**kwargs`, and context management (`with` statement).
- Go through tuple properties, enumerate, and zip functions.
- End the day with a general review and more practice MCQs.

### Additional Tips:

- **Practice with Purpose**: Focus on practicing MCQs similar to the ones you provided. This will help you get used to the format and the kind of questions that may appear in the exam.
- **Understand, Don’t Memorize**: Try to understand the logic behind each concept rather than just memorizing code snippets.
- **Time Management**: During the exam, if you're stuck on a question, move on and return to it later.
- **Rest Well**: Make sure to rest adequately, especially the night before the exam. A fresh mind is as important as thorough preparation.

Remember, the key to success in MCQ exams is understanding the concepts and recognizing patterns in questions and answers.
