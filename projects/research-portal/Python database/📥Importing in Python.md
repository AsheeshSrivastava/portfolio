# Detailed Notes
In the Python code snippet you provided, various modules, functions, and classes are being imported. Let's break down each import statement:

1. **`import sys`**
    
    - **sys**: This is a module. It provides access to some variables used or maintained by the Python interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.
2. **`import keyword`**
    
    - **keyword**: This is also a module. It is used to check whether a string is a Python keyword.
3. **`import operator`**
    
    - **operator**: This is a module as well. It exports a set of efficient functions corresponding to the intrinsic operators of Python. For example, `operator.add` is the equivalent of the `+` operator.
4. **`from datetime import datetime`**
    
    - **datetime (from datetime)**: Here, `datetime` is a class within the `datetime` module. It represents both the date and time, down to microsecond granularity.
5. **`import os`**
    
    - **os**: This is a module that provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.
