# Detailed Notes
In Python, everything is an object. An object is an encapsulation of variables (attributes) and functions (methods) into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create objects.

A more detailed explanation:

1. **Attributes and Methods**:
    
    - An attribute is a characteristic of an object (e.g., a file object might have a name, a path, a file size).
    - A method is a function that is associated with an object. It can perform operations using the attributes of the object or change the object's state (e.g., a file object might have methods to open, read, write, or close the file).
2. **Instantiation**:
    
    - The process of creating an object from a class is called instantiation. When an object is created, it's said to be an instance of a class.
3. **Classes**:
    
    - Classes define the structure and behavior of objects. They act like a blueprint for creating objects.
    - A class can have its own attributes (called class attributes) and methods (class methods).
4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
    
    - Python is an object-oriented programming language. This means it supports the concepts of classes and objects, allowing for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
5. **Identity, Type, and Value**:
    
    - Each object in Python has an identity (which you can think of as its address in memory), a type (which defines the kinds of things the object can do), and a value (the actual data within the object).

For example, consider a Python list. It's an object:

- **Class**: `list`
- **Instance/Object**: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
- **Attributes**: The contents of the list, `[1, 2, 3]`
- **Methods**: Functions like `my_list.append(4)`, `my_list.remove(1)`

This concept is central to Python and underpins its ease of use and the way it handles data and functions.
