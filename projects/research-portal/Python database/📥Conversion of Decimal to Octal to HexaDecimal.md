### Representation

| Number System | Example              |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Decimal       | 1, 11, 23, ...       |
| Octal         | 001, 011, 023, ...   |
| Hexadecimal   | 0x1, 0x11, 0x23, ... |


- **Decimal**: This is the standard number system that we use in everyday life. It is base-10, which means it uses ten different digits (0-9).
- **Octal**: This is base-8 number system which uses digits from 0 to 7. Each octal digit represents three binary digits. For instance, the decimal number 8 is represented as 10 in octal.
- **Hexa Decimal**: This is base-16 number system. It uses sixteen distinct symbols. 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A–F (or a–f) to represent values ten to fifteen. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented as 'A' in hexadecimal.

In the octal and hexadecimal columns, after the 7th and 15th entries respectively, the pattern starts with a new set of symbols to continue the count. In octal, after 7 comes 10 (representing 8 in decimal), and in hexadecimal, after F comes 10 (representing 16 in decimal).

This explanation provides a breakdown of how numbers are translated from decimal to octal and hexadecimal. It's important to understand these conversions, especially in computing and digital electronics, where binary (base-2), octal (base-8), and hexadecimal (base-16) number systems are commonly used.

```python
num1 = 100
```

```python
print(num1)
```

```python
num2 = 0b1010
```

```python
print(num2)
```

```python
print(bin(10))
```

```python
print(bin(num2))
```

```python
num3 = 0o20
```

```python
print(num3)
```

```python
print(hex(num3))
```

```python
num4 = 0x2F
```

```python
print(num4)
```

```python
oct(num4)
```

```python
bin(num4)
```

```python
print(num4)
```

```python
val = 15
```

```python
print(val)
```

```python
print(bin(val))
```

```python
print(oct(val))
```

```python
print(hex(val))
```
