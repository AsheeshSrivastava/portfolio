**Action:** Practice your 60-second video script OUT LOUD

**Steps:**
1. Open `QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md`
2. Read the script section (page 1)
3. Say it out loud 5 times
4. Time yourself (should be ~60 seconds)
5. Practice until it sounds natural, not robotic

**Script to memorize (first 2 paragraphs minimum):**
```
Hi, I'm Asheesh, founder of Quest & Crossfire, where I turn chaos
into clarity through systems thinking and AI collaboration.

I have 6+ years building data-driven systems in the social impact
sector - training over 400 professionals, leading 10-member teams,
and designing programs that scaled across 5 states in India.

But here's what excites me now: I'm an AI-native builder.

Through the OutSkill AI Bootcamp, I've deployed two production
applications in just 3 weeks - an Obsidian AI Learning Assistant
and a Multi-Persona Chatbot - both live at questandcrossfire.com.
```

**Key phrases to emphasize:**
- "turn chaos into clarity"
- "6+ years" / "400+ professionals"
- "AI-native builder"
- "deployed two production applications in 3 weeks"

**✓ Done when:** You can say the first 2 paragraphs naturally without reading
