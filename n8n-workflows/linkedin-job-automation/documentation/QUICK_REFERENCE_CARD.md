## 🎬 RECOMMENDED SCRIPT (60 seconds - MEMORIZE THIS)

```
Hi, I'm Asheesh, founder of Quest & Crossfire, where I turn chaos
into clarity through systems thinking and AI collaboration.

I have 6+ years building data-driven systems in the social impact
sector - training over 400 professionals, leading 10-member teams,
and designing programs that scaled across 5 states in India.

But here's what excites me now: I'm an AI-native builder.

Through the OutSkill AI Bootcamp, I've deployed two production
applications in just 3 weeks - an Obsidian AI Learning Assistant
and a Multi-Persona Chatbot - both live at questandcrossfire.com.

I architect the vision, AI handles the implementation. That's how
I'm building Quest & Crossfire's learning platform - currently
85% MVP-ready for Q1 2026 launch.

My tech stack? Python, Streamlit, OpenAI API, Hugging Face
Transformers, n8n automation, and Power BI.

I'm also completing my Master's in Computer Science focused on
AI and Machine Learning.

I'm seeking AI Product Manager or Technical Product Manager roles
starting January 2026 - where systems thinking meets AI collaboration
to build products that help people learn and grow.

Check out my live projects at questandcrossfire.com, or connect
with me on LinkedIn. Let's build something impactful together!
