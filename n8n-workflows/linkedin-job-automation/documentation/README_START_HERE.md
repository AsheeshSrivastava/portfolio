## 🎯 RECOMMENDED: SCRIPT 1 (CONVERSATIONAL, 60 SECONDS)

**This is your best option. Practice this 3 times before class:**

```
Hi, I'm Asheesh, founder of Quest & Crossfire, where I turn chaos
into clarity through systems thinking and AI collaboration.

I have 6+ years building data-driven systems in the social impact
sector - training over 400 professionals, leading 10-member teams,
and designing programs that scaled across 5 states in India.

But here's what excites me now: I'm an AI-native builder.

Through the OutSkill AI Bootcamp, I've deployed two production
applications in just 3 weeks - an Obsidian AI Learning Assistant
and a Multi-Persona Chatbot - both live at questandcrossfire.com.

I architect the vision, AI handles the implementation. That's how
I'm building Quest & Crossfire's learning platform - currently
85% MVP-ready for Q1 2026 launch.

My tech stack? Python, Streamlit, OpenAI API, Hugging Face
Transformers, n8n automation, and Power BI.

I'm also completing my Master's in Computer Science focused on
AI and Machine Learning.

I'm seeking AI Product Manager or Technical Product Manager roles
starting January 2026 - where systems thinking meets AI collaboration
to build products that help people learn and grow.

Check out my live projects at questandcrossfire.com, or connect
with me on LinkedIn. Let's build something impactful together!
```

**⏱️ Duration:** ~60 seconds at natural pace

## 📖 DURING CLASS - WHAT TO DO

→ Practice once more before hitting record
→ Smile at start and end!

### **When Building Workflow:**
→ Follow instructor's guidance
→ Reference `profile_data.json` for structured data
→ Use your actual portfolio links (both apps are live!)

### **If Asked About Projects:**
→ "I've deployed two production AI applications:
   Obsidian AI Learning Assistant and Multi-Persona Chatbot.
   Both are live at questandcrossfire.com. Built in 3 weeks
   through AI-native development approach."

## 🎓 FRAMING YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS (Important!)

**You mentioned: "None of the apps have any users; they have been just deployed"**

**Here's how we've reframed this positively:**

❌ **AVOID SAYING:**
- "No users yet"
- "Just deployed"
- "Not tested with real users"
- "Just learning"

✅ **INSTEAD SAY:**
- "Production-ready applications deployed and live"
- "Recently launched with full functionality"
- "Built in 3 weeks using AI-native development"
- "Live at questandcrossfire.com for demonstration"
- "Showcasing hands-on AI engineering capabilities"

**Key insight:** For bootcamp projects and portfolio pieces, DEPLOYMENT IS THE ACHIEVEMENT! You shipped production code, configured hosting, integrated APIs, and made it publicly accessible. That's impressive regardless of user count.

---

## 💡 CONFIDENCE BOOSTERS

**You are WELL PREPARED because:**

1. ✅ You completed all Day 4 prep (n8n setup, concepts, materials)
2. ✅ You have 2 LIVE deployed applications (not everyone can say this!)
3. ✅ You have 6+ years professional experience (strong foundation)
4. ✅ You're building in public (Quest & Crossfire brand)
5. ✅ You have clear career goals (Jan 2026, specific roles)
6. ✅ You've shipped code in 3 weeks (AI-native approach works!)
7. ✅ You have comprehensive documentation ready (these files!)

**Your video resume will stand out because:**
- Most people don't have live projects to show
- Your systems thinking angle is unique
- Your AI-native approach is timely and impressive
- Your professional background adds depth
